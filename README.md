# Classification_Trees

This project was completed to demonstrate understanding of decision trees. 

Now let's discuss how to interpret the tree. In each node, we have:
This demonstrates that I loaded the data from a file, identified adn dealt with missing data, formatted data for decision trees using one-hot encoding, 
built a decision tree fro classication, pruned the decision tree with cost complexity pruning, built, drew, interpreted and evaluted the final decision tree. 

If I were to complete this project again, I would use random forest to limit overfitting from the beginning; However, the overall exercise was good for understanding
one-hot encoding and graphical representation.
